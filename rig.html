<h1>My PC Specs (and server nonsense)</h1>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">Why does this exist?</h3>
A few people asked about the what and whys of my PC(s), so I thought I'd put them here. <br />
<br />
<h4>Main Rig: (Built early 2025)</h4>
A high-performance build designed to still be money-concsious. <br />
<li><b>CPU:</b> AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3D </li>
All around good CPU. Could have upgraded to a 9950, but there was really no point, even if it seems like a good deal nonetheless.
<li><b>CPU Cooler:</b> Thermalright Peerless Assassin</li>
What is there to say, it's an exceptional cooler for the price. Cools the 9800x3D perfectly fine. I was considering a Noctua NH-D15 but it's completely outclassed in price-to-performance here. <br />
<li><b>GPU:</b> NVidia GeForce RTX 5080</li>
Picked over any of AMDs offerings because AMD doesn't really sell a card comparable to this in performance. I had money to spare, so I decided to grab the best I can get. <br />
<li><b>RAM:</b> 128GB (4x32GB) of DDR5-6000 CL18 sticks from Silicon Power</li>
Not much to say about these other than they were cheap for DDR5 and 6000MT/s is fast enough. Yes, I am aware of the performance impacts of 4 sticks of RAM. I do not care. <br />
<li><b>Storage:</b> A Generic 1TB SSD from my old Rig (See Media Server below) and a 2TB Samsung 990</li>
Also not much to say here. They work, and they are plenty fast. <br />
<li><b>Motherboard:</b> Gigabyte B850 GAMING WIFI6</li>
Picked for it's port selection. Plenty of USB, Ethernet, and Audio to go around. It's a nice mobo. <br />
<li><b>PSU:</b> SeaSonic VERTEX P-1000 80+ Platinum Modular ATX PSU (1000W)</li>
2 Main requirements for this part: 80 Plus certification and SeaSonic made. <br />
I picked SeaSonic specifically due to that absolutely ballsy move they made to sponsor the PSU Tester for LTT Labs. <br />
Sponsoring that means they are sure to be tested to their claims and it shows confidence in their products. Also, their warranties are good, and they actually honor them. +👍 for SeaSonic. <br />
<li><b>Case:</b> Fractal Design North XL</li>
There were a few requirements for this case: <br />
<ul>
  <li>No stupid glass side panel (I leave my PC on at night sometimes, and any RGB in the case prevents me from sleeping.)</li>
  <li>Good airflow</li>
  <li>Good looking</li>
  <li>Ideally, white colored.</li>
</ul>
I'm never buying a cheap case again. This case was a dream to build in, roomy and completely ventillated. It ticks all the boxes, and it looks excellent. <br />
I particularly like the side-panel fan spots, which allowed me to put a few fans for intake to the GPU to keep it nice and cool. <br />
(All Noctua by the way, I've personally seen these fans go through hell and back and be basically new still, and I love the brown.) <br />
Front IO is really good (Headphone & Mic, 2x USB-A, 1x USB-C) and the built-in cable management is excellent. <br />
The only thing I think I would have wanted over this is the Silverstone FLP-02 but it wasn't out when I built it. (nor as I write this, guys, when is this releasing? I WANT MY SLEEPER CASE) <br />
<li><b>Monitor(s):</b> an LG UltraGear 34GS95QE-B 34" 3440x1440@240Hz Ultrawide with HDR True Black 400 and G-Sync/FreeSync, and a few free "good enough" 1080p 16:9 monitors from various places (I've had them for years.) one is mounted vertically.</li>
I've been meaning to get a set of monitor arms for the 3-monitor setup I got going here. The Ultrawide is excellent, and I fucking love it. I'm never playing games 16:9 again. <br />
<li><b>Operating System:</b> Arch Linux with KDE Plasma as my desktop environment, and fish for the shell.</li>
I could go on and on about linux, but nah. Instead, the silly details of my config: <br />
No swap - 128GB of RAM is plenty. I considered a paging file or swap partition but it's completely unnessessary with *that* much RAM. <br />
Cursor has been set to Posy's Cursor, as I like it. Black-on-white FTW. Similarly, the system-wide monospaced font is the one you are reading this page in right now, Iosevka with some customisations. <br />
I am using yakuake [sic] for a terminal, as it ships with KDE and it's really cool. <br />
<li><b>Extras:</b> A Schiit Audio Magni Unity DAC+Headphone Amp paired with a pair of Custom Cans modded Beyerdynamic DT770s, a Samson Go meteor mic, and a NanoKVM Pro Desk for remote access. The desk itself is a discontinued IKEA Jerker desk. <br />
Everything here is a hard recommend. Audio stuff sounds great, and the KVM is nice to have. The desk is nice, but again, discontinued. <br />
Eventually, I plan to build a custom desk. Also, I should make a hardware "Media Volume" slider box and other assorted shit for my PC. <br />
<br />
<h4>The Media Server and NAS</h4>
There's nothing special about this PC. It's literally my old rig, save for about 10TB of random ass drives crammed into it. <br />
It's got a Intel Xeon ES-1650 v3 (about equivalent to a i7-7700K) and a EVGA 1070 for transcoding. 32 GBs of RAM tops off the tower of mediocrity. <br />
It's "good enough" for my needs and runs Debian without a DE, and I SSH into it. It's running Copyparty for NAS use and Jellyfin on top for media. Caddy provides a reverse-proxy for the services running within. It works well. <br />
