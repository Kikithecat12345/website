<h1>Kikicat123's Ultimate Puzzle Game List (pat. pending)</h1>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0%;">What is this?</h3>
This is a list of puzzle games I've played, and my thoughts on them. I'll try to keep it updated, but I'm lazy, and often forgetful, so no promises. <br />
If I've missed any games, contact me on Discord (kikicat123) or email me at kiki (at) (this domain). I'll add them to the list. <br /> <br />
These puzzle games all have a few things in common: <br />
a) They are all pretty hard, but very rewarding. I'd encourage you to not look things up while playing. <br />
b) They are (almost) all on steam. I prefer to use steam for games, but i've made exceptions for some games. <br />
c) They have all passed my worth-it metric: For every Canadian Dollar spent, I've gotten at least 1 hour of entertainment. <br />
<s>Prices listed are as of April 2023. I have probably accidentally included a sale price, If I have let me know.</s> <br />
<b>Thanks to Melon for creating some JS to ping the Steam API for prices! Fallbacks may still be sale prices.</b><br />
Prices are automatically converted to current prices using the Steam API, hover over the price to see the original price as of August 2023.<br />

    <br />
    Non-steam Games: <br />
    Differentiated because they do not work with the price-check system above. As such, if their price changes, it will not be shown here. <br />
    Of course, they are still great games, however.

    <br />
    Games I have not played but have heard are good: <br />
    These games have not been evaluated by me, but friends of mine have recommended it be added to the list. I will put these here.

    <br />
    Other Games: <br />
    These are games that don't fit into the traditional sense of "Puzzle games" but are still puzzley in nature, so i've included them anyway. <br />
    They still meet the worth-it metrics, but aren't nessesarially the same style of experience as above.
